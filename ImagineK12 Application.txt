* Please tell us about the origins of your interest in the field of education. Describe any experience or expertise you have in K-12 education.
We were always keeping track of changes in education as we wanted our son's experience to be better than ours. While doing this, we were surprised to find out that teachers still used paper records and the internet was only thought of as a waste of time. Since we had been on the lookout for a promising space for building a webapp, this thought struck home and we wanted to make a webapp for schools. 

We brainstormed a couple of ideas in education, including a webapp for making notes from web pages and media. Shenuja worked with a friend (with Subhash contributing part-time) to make a prototype for implementing the CCE system for CBSE schools. But the real breakthrough was when we realized that any of these features will require a social communication platform beneath them. Thus was born Schoolarly.

We have no direct experience in education but we have learnt a lot through Shenuja's father and sister who have taught in schools, many teacher-friends and some cousins still in school. We got sneak-peeks inside the educational processes while selecting a school to enroll our son in.


* Please tell us in a sentence or two about the most impressive thing other than this startup that each of the founders has built or achieved.
When Subhash' doctor advised him to move out of Bangalore to avoid pollution, we had to give up our jobs in Google and Cisco. Since there we no software jobs in our small town, we created jobs for ourselves through consulting and drew salaries that were 4 times Google's.

Shenuja paid for her high-school and college with the National Talent Search Examination (NTSE) scholarship. The exam was conducted to select 750 students from all over India for proficiency in science and mathematics.

When he was 14, Subhash wrote a 10000 line Hangman game in a GW-BASIC program that could list only 10 lines of code at a time.

* Please tell us about an interesting project, preferably outside of class or work, that two or more of you created together. Include URLs if possible.
We wanted to use FogBugz within Eclipse and were disappointed to see that they didn't have a Mylyn connector. So we created Bugclipse, which could import FogBugz cases as Mylyn tasks and generate reports on them. We quickly wrapped it into a product with license management, online sales etc. to gauge the market. A few users were very excited, but the market for FogBugz-Eclipse integration was limited. But the experience gave us valuable insights into marketing and customer support.

We also worked together on a CCE system for CBSE schools with a friend, which helped us get a lot of customer feedback

* How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person?
We have known each other for the past 10 years and have been married for almost 7 years. We will totally understand if you don't want to mediate cofounder disputes in our case :-)

We met at our first jobs at Cisco Systems, Bangalore. We were part of a team developing a web-interfaced application for managing routers and switches.



Tell us about your company/idea

* Company Name.
Schoolarly

Company URL, if any.
www.schoolarly.com

* What is your company going to make? Why did you pick this idea to work on?

Schoolarly is Blackboard, done the facebook way. 

It will allow teachers and students to work on assignments, make lesson plans, have discussions and share stuff like how they'd do it on facebook. School admins can post notices, plan events and accept fee payments, without the hassle of installing and maintaining servers. Students can share all their works and grades as one lifetime portfolio.

The paths of information between a student and a teacher will come through the courses he's enrolled for, but it can be enhanced by 'following' a teacher too. This will lead to discovery of information and resources, the way you hear about an interesting local event on facebook.

We iterated over many ideas before we realized teachers were struggling with the very basic use-cases. Also, a tool to make lesson plans would not make sense without messaging, commenting and a student list.  Since none of the schools we spoke to, vouched for a particular LMS platform we decided to build our own.

The possibilities are promising. Schoolarly could evolve into a platform for third-party school applications or use the community of students for targeted ads. We could provide virtual classes for e-tutors and provide a marketplace for their study material in the lines of tutorspree.

 

* How do you know someone needs what you're making? Who are the intended users (e.g., parents, teachers, students)?


None of the schools in India use Blackboard. They use a set of haphazard solutions for their requirements like Renweb for administration, Turnitin for assignments, eCollege for lessonplanning etc. It's evident that they know these solutions don't scale, that an integrated solution is inevitable.

When we talked about Schoolarly in the TAISI conference in bangalore, the teachers immediately 'got' it. One of them took pains to explain to the sysadmin in her school how they wouldn't need to go about clicking their way to something, instead they would find it right there in the dashboard. 

A school principal told us they are prepared to take up to $10000/year from the school's budget for a solution that would help them be in touch with the parent over email and SMS.

Teachers are disappointed when we tell them Schoolarly is not already available in this academic year.

We see online reports of dissatisfaction in Blackboard and other existing solutions by teachers and students. The ***** summarizes it all. We're building exactly what a student here has envisioned , representing the community of Blackboard users.

The intended users are everyone related to the education field. Parents, teachers, students, School Administrators, E-tutors. Competitive exam co-ordinators,  student summer camp organizers...

* What is new about what you're making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about it)?
Schools, teachers, students and parents combined have the following needs: communication, assessment, lesson planning, admissions, fees. Blackboard attempts to solve most of these but is cumbersome to maintain and use. RenWeb is a desk-application and gives only reports to students and parents. Turnitin, Engrade solve only subsets of the whole problem - so, data will be scattered for users. All these applications 

In Schoolarly, school admins would find setup to be as simple as signing up, creating a school and inviting users. Teachers will see relevant information right there in their dashboard. While studying for an exam, a student can search over all the assignments, lesson plans, Q&As from one search-box instead of hardcopies and multiple websites.

Teachers use the software systems to store information and use other means (paper, email) to communicate. They keep paper files of assignments and projects to maintain a portfolio on a student. Students submit assignments in CDs

Schoolarly enables teachers and students to collaborate across school boundaries for preparing for a competitive exam, say

* Who are your competitors and who might become competitors? Who do you fear the most?
Blackboard has a huge install base but they need dedicated people to install and maintain their software. They don't have a hosted solution except for installing a seat on their servers and letting you use it. RenWeb is gaining traction in India through a reseller. Moodle and Pearson eCollege are other solutions. Point solutions like turnitin and engrade are quite good but are limited in features.

Blackboard might acquire a nimble startup with a cloud application and transition their users to that. But given their investment in support and sales, they might not be eager to take this approach

Turnitin might expand their offering wide enough to become what Schoolarly wants to be

* What do you understand about education that other companies just don't get?
Any useful feature in education needs to be set in context

Teachers' expectations of software are set by facebook and gmail and they are put off by ERP-style database forms.

* How do you plan to distribute your product?
Schools register online and add teacher and student accounts

* How do or how will you make money? How much could you make? We realize you can't know precisely, but give your best estimate (rough estimates only, no spreadsheets).

The market for school management software in India is about 2000 schools (150 international + 750 ICSE + 1100 CBSE). Each school charges about $2-3 million/year as fees - the student fee varies from $2000 (CBSE, small-town) to $10000 (international, metro city).  We have confirmation from schools that they can afford upto $10000/year for a complete software solution. So, we would place our potential annual revenue at $20 million from  subscriptions from Indian schools alone.

We do not have first-hand information about the US market. But industry reports suggest that for Blackboard, the maintenance fee alone could be $70000/year. We find that all other software – RenWeb etc charge in the range of $10000/year which is probably a more realistic estimate without all the sales overhead that Blackboard undertakes.

If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them. One may be something we've been waiting for.



Tell us about your progress and future plans

* If you've already started working on it, how long have you been working and about how many lines of code (if applicable) have you written?
4 months, 6000 LOC

* How far along are you? Do you have a beta yet? If not, when will you? Are you launched? If so how many users do you have? Do you have revenue? If you're launched, what is your monthly growth rate (in user and/or revenue)?
With a couple of features more, our beta version would be ready. The schools we have spoken to are less interested in test-driving the product and more interested in paying for and using a polished version.

We plan to launch and start signing up schools by August. We will also demo during the TAISI admin conference in Hyderabad in September to get new introductions.

If you have an online demo, what's the url? (Please don't password protect it; just make it an obscure url.)
