* Please tell us about the origins of your interest in the field of education. Describe any experience or expertise you have in K-12 education.
We were always keeping track of changes in education as we wanted our son's experience to be better than ours. While doing this, we were surprised to find out that teachers still used paper records and the internet was only thought of as a waste of time. Since we had been on the lookout for a promising space for building a webapp, this thought struck home and we wanted to make a webapp for schools. 

We brainstormed a couple of ideas in education, including a webapp for making notes from web pages and media. Shenuja worked with a friend (with Subhash contributing part-time) to make a prototype for implementing the CCE system for CBSE schools. But the real breakthrough was when we realized that any of these features will require a social communication platform beneath them. Thus was born Schoolarly.

We have no direct experience in education but we have learnt a lot through Shenuja's father and sister who have taught in schools, many teacher-friends and some cousins still in school. We got sneak-peeks inside the educational processes while selecting a school to enroll our son in.


* Please tell us in a sentence or two about the most impressive thing other than this startup that each of the founders has built or achieved.
When Subhash' doctor advised him to move out of Bangalore to avoid pollution, we had to give up our jobs in Google and Cisco. Since there we no software jobs in our small town, we created jobs for ourselves through consulting and drew salaries that were 4 times Google's.

Shenuja paid for her high-school and college with the National Talent Search Examination (NTSE) scholarship. The exam was conducted to select 750 students from all over India for proficiency in science and mathematics.

When he was 14, Subhash wrote a 10000 line Hangman game in a GW-BASIC program that could list only 10 lines of code at a time.

* Please tell us about an interesting project, preferably outside of class or work, that two or more of you created together. Include URLs if possible.
We wanted to use FogBugz within Eclipse and were disappointed to see that they didn't have a Mylyn connector. So we created Bugclipse, which could import FogBugz cases as Mylyn tasks and generate reports on them. We quickly wrapped it into a product with license management, online sales etc. to gauge the market. A few users were very excited, but the market for FogBugz-Eclipse integration was limited. But the experience gave us valuable insights into marketing and customer support.

We also worked together on a CCE system for CBSE schools with a friend, which helped us get a lot of customer feedback

* How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person?
We have known each other for the past 10 years and have been married for almost 7 years. We will totally understand if you don't want to mediate cofounder disputes in our case :-)

We met at our first jobs at Cisco Systems, Bangalore. We were part of a team developing a web-interfaced application for managing routers and switches.



Tell us about your company/idea

* Company Name.
Schoolarly

Company URL, if any.
www.schoolarly.com

* What is your company going to make? Why did you pick this idea to work on?
Schoolarly is Blackboard, done the facebook way. It will allow teachers and students to work on assignments, make lesson plans, have discussions and share stuff like they are doing it on facebook. We iterated over many ideas before we realized teachers were struggling with the very basic use-cases - and that we needed to build that platform which is imperative for the features above

* How do you know someone needs what you're making? Who are the intended users (e.g., parents, teachers, students)?
When we talked about Schoolarly in the TAISI conference in bangalore, the teachers immediately 'get' it. One of them took pains to explain to the sysadmin in her school how they wouldn't need to go about clicking their way to something, instead they would find it right there in the page. 

A school principal told us they are prepared to take up to $10000/year from the school's budget for a solution that would help them be in touch with the parent over email and SMS.

Teachers are disappointed when we tell them Schoolarly is not already available in this academic year

* What is new about what you're making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about it)?
When teachers log in to their school management system, they are forced to grapple with the complex view of the entire school. Schoolarly inverts the view, puts the user in the driver's seat and uses the school organization information to connect them to other users

Schoolarly focusses on the individuals and views the school and class as the connections between them. This inverts the way the current systems work and puts the student or the teacher in the driver's seat 

Teachers use the software systems to store information and use other means (paper, email) to communicate. They keep paper files of assignments and projects to maintain a portfolio on a student. Students submit assignments in CDs

* Who are your competitors and who might become competitors? Who do you fear the most?
Blackboard has a huge install base but they need dedicated people to install and maintain their software. They don't have a hosted solution except for installing a seat on their servers and letting you use it. RenWeb is gaining traction in India through a reseller. Moodle and Pearson eCollege are other solutions. Point solutions like turnitin and engrade are quite good but are limited in features.

Blackboard might acquire a nimble startup with a cloud application and transition their users to that. But given their investment in support and sales, they might not be eager to take this approach

* What do you understand about education that other companies just don't get?
Any useful feature in education needs to be set in context

Teachers' expectations of software are set by facebook and gmail and they are put off by ERP-style database forms.

* How do you plan to distribute your product?
Schools register online and add teacher and student accounts

* How do or how will you make money? How much could you make? We realize you can't know precisely, but give your best estimate (rough estimates only, no spreadsheets).

If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them. One may be something we've been waiting for.



Tell us about your progress and future plans

* If you've already started working on it, how long have you been working and about how many lines of code (if applicable) have you written?
4 months, 6000 LOC

* How far along are you? Do you have a beta yet? If not, when will you? Are you launched? If so how many users do you have? Do you have revenue? If you're launched, what is your monthly growth rate (in user and/or revenue)?
With a couple of features more, our beta version would be ready. The schools we have spoken to are less interested in test-driving the product and more interested in paying for and using a polished version.

We plan to launch and start signing up schools by August. We will also demo during the TAISI admin conference in Hyderabad in September to get new introductions.

If you have an online demo, what's the url? (Please don't password protect it; just make it an obscure url.)
http://demo.schoolarly.com/demo

* If you're not incorporated yet, please list the percent of the company you plan to give each founder, and anyone else you plan to give stock to (this question is as much for you as us).
50% each

* If we select you, which founders will commit to working exclusively on this project for the next year?
Subhash and Shenuja

For founders who can't, why not? What level of commitment are they willing to make?
NA

* Do any founders have any other commitments between June and September 2011 inclusive?
No

* Do any founders have commitments in the future (e.g., finishing college, grad school), and if so what?
No

* Where do you live now, and where would the company be based after Imagine K12?
We live and work from Kochi, India and would prefer to base the company in the US after Imagine K12

* Are any of the founders covered by noncompetes or intellectual property agreements that overlap with your project? Will any be working as employees or consultants for anyone else?
No

* Are any of the following true? (a) You are the only founder (b) You are a student who may return to school when the next term starts (c) Half or more of your group can't move to the Bay Area (d) one or more founder will keep their current jobs (e) none of the founders are programmers.

(Answering yes doesn't disqualify you, it's just to remind us to check.)

no
yes

* Please tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you has discovered. (The answer need not be related to your project.)
