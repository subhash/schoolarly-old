	<td>&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Welcome&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! I have a few things to say to you all, and one of them is very serious..&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;As you will all be aware after their search of the Hogwarts Express, our school is presently playing host to some of the dementors of Azkaban, who are here on Ministry of Magic business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are stationed at every entrance to the grounds, and while they are with us, I must make it plain that nobody is to leave school without permission. Dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises - or even Invisibility Cloaks. It is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading or excuses. I therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you. I look to the prefects, and our new Head Boy and Girl, to make sure that no student runs afoul of the dementors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a happier note, I am pleased to welcome two new teachers to our ranks this year. First, &lt;strong&gt;Professor Lupin&lt;/strong&gt;, who has kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.&lt;br /&gt;As to our second new appointment, well, I am sorry to tell you that Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher, retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs. However, I am delighted to say that his place will be filled by none other than &lt;strong&gt;Rubeus Hagrid&lt;/strong&gt;, who has agreed to take on this teaching job in addition to his gamekeeping duties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</td>
