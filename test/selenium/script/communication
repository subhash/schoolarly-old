Hi

Welcome to schoolarly

Let me show you how we enable communication and collaboration between teachers and students

Let me first login as Severus Snape, the chemistry teacher. He has a lot of work today. 
He needs to make an announcement to Hogwarts school, plan an event for class 1A and make some notes for his chemistry class tomorrow

It's a breeze to do all these in Schoolarly. All my groups - Hogwarts, 1A and my chemistry class are easily accessible on the right side. 

Let me go to the school to send everyone a message   

Next, I create an event for class 1A. This event will come up in the dashboard and calendar of all students and teachers of 1A 

Now, I go to my Chemistry group where I want to publish my notes for tomorrow's class. 
I have the option to type it all in with formatting right here or attach a document that I have ready
My students will be able to see this note and put up their comments and discussions right on this page

Oh, I just remembered I need to send a private message to three of my students.

Here, I am done.

Now, we will login as Harry Potter to view communication from a student's point of view

The dashboard brings up all the recent communications made to any group Harry is part of.

He can select to see only notes, messages or photos. He can also go to specific groups to see communication in that group

Harry views the chemistry note and asks a question

His calendar shows the field trip event in April

When he checks his inbox, he sees the message from Professor Snape

Communication doesn't end here. Teachers and students can collaborate over assignments and grading. We'll show you how that works
in a different video. Goodbye until then
