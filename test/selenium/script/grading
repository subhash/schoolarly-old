
Welcome to schoolarly's demonstration video for grading. 
I will be showing you how to post an assignment, accept submissions from students, assess the submissions and 
enable students to view the teacher's evaluation comments and grade

Before posting an assignment, you may want to create a rubric, which is basically an assessment tool. 
Clicking on create rubric brings up an empty rubric
The 3 rows you see are called criteria or dimensions for the assessment
The 4 columns are called levels or scale of values for each criterion
You can add or remove the criteria and levels to suit your assessment need
You will be able to enter names for the levels and criteria by clicking in its place

If this seems like a tedious task to you, there's an easy way out. You can use a rubric from the library as a template and edit only the parts you want changed. The Rubric library you see here is a collection of all the rubrics you have created and the ones other teachers have shared with you. 
For eg, I will pick this rubric and edit the level points and criterion weightages
Once you are happy with the rubric you created, save it

Go to the class or subject group where you want to post the assignment and click on Post assignment
You can either enter formatted text or attach a document that describes the assignment
The start date specifies when this assignment will be posted to the group and the due date is the date until whicj
submissions will be accepted
Here, you can pick the rubric you created and enter a total score for the assignment if required
