        title: Socialize your classroom

          first: 
            one: You would like your students to participate more in discussions surrounding assignments. You need to zero in on those who are finding it difficult to master the material. You would like it if students could contribute their own ideas and references from the internet. You also want them to help each other out when they are stuck at a problem.
            two: Schoolarly lets you manage all this by creating a discussion-space around each assignment and lesson-plan.
          second: 
            one: Review assignments online in Schoolarly. 
            two: You can annotate with inline comments, hightlights, strikeouts or draw sketches right within the assignment. All these markings are preserved for the student in his online copy and she can download the document with the markings intact. You can also grade the assignments with a simple score or using your own rubric scale. While using a rubric, the total score is automatically calculated and can be overwritten, if necessary.

They can either compose the submission in the online editor or upload a document. As and when they work on the assignment, they can save draft copies and finally submit it when it's ready. They will received the reviewed assignment with comments from the teacher once it is graded. The score is shown along with the rubric scale used for the assignment 
          second: 
            title: Track your events
            content: Schoolarly provides every student and teacher with an online calendar where any of the activities they are part of - assignments, classes, projects, sport events are marked.

      q_1:
        question: How do I log in to Schoolarly?
        answer: |
         <p>
          When your school or college signs up for Schoolarly, you will receive an email with the subject "Invitation from <administrator>", which will contain a link to reset your account's password. 
          Click on this to set a new password.
         </p>
          <p>
          You can visit <a href="http://www.schoolarly.com">www.schoolarly.com</a> from any computer with a browser and internet connection. 
          You need to click on the "Login" link and enter your email and the password you set to view your pages on Schoolarly.
          </p>
      q_2:
        question: How do I change my password?
        answer: |
          <p>After you login to Schoolarly, you will notice a "Change password" link at the bottom of every page. Clicking on this takes you to the "Change password" page.</p>
      q_3:
        question: How do I change my profile picture?
        answer: |
          <p>Click on the "Edit profile" link at the bottom of the Schoolarly page, click on the "Choose file" button to choose a photo file and click on "Update profile" button. </p>

        question: How do I share a document with all the students in my class?
        answer: |
          <p>Go to the group page and click on Note from the right bar. After providing a title, you can type in the document with formatting in the box below.
          If you would instead prefer to attach a pdf, doc or ppt file, click on "Or upload a document" and choose the file before clicking on "Create Post"</p>
          <p>Once the document is posted, it is viewable by all the group members. If the document is an uploaded file, Schoolarly displays it with a viewer within document page.
           The file can also be downloaded by clicking on the "Download" link at the top of the page.</p>
      q_3:
        question: How do I send an assignment to my students?
        answer: |
          <p>Go to the group page and click on Activity from the right bar. Enter a title for the assignment and provide the text in the box or attach a document. Change the "published at" field if you want the assignment to be seen by students after a certain date. </p>
          <p>Select "Invite student submissions" if you would like students to be able to submit their answers online. This is usually a good idea for assignment activities. Select a due date for student submissions.
          You can ignore the other date field which usually applies for class-activities like exams, group discussions etc. </p>
          <p>You can enter a total score and attach a rubric (see advanced section) for the assignment which will be useful for grading after the students send in their submissions </p>
          <p>Click on create to create the assignment. </p>
      q_4:
        question: How do students make submissions to the assignments I give?
        answer: |
          <p>As soon as your assignment is published in Schoolarly, students of the group will see it in their homepage when they log in. 
          On the assignment page, they can read about the assignment and post their questions. Some of them may have suggestions on where to find more resources on that topic or related information. 
          They can use the comments features for these needs. You can answer their questions and interact with them through your homepage.</p>
          <p>They can compose their answer or attach a document as their submission for the assignment. If the submission is not yet complete, they can save it as a draft for later use by clicking on "Save draft". 
          Once they are done with the assignment, they can click the "Submit" button to allow the teacher to review their submission. </p>
      q_5:
        question: How do I grade assignments and provide comments?
        answer: |
          <p>Once a student submits an assignment, it shows up against their name in the assignment page. You can view their submission document within the page and can make comments and markings while reviewing them. 
          You can even draw on the submission to illustrate a point or underline some text. All these annotations will be viewable by the student who submitted that entry.</p>
          <p>You can also enter a score for the submission. Once all the submissions of the students are graded, you can click on "Publish grades" to allow them to see the results of your evaluation. </p>

        question: What is the best way to track examinations in Schoolarly?
        answer: |
          <p>A good way to track examinations is to create them as activities in the group. Go to the group page and click on "Activity" in the right bar. 
          Enter a title and description and leave "Invite student submissions" unselected. Enter the date and time of the examination and the total score it'll be graded for.</p>
          <p>One of the advantages of tracking examinations as activities is that they automatically show up in the calendar of each student (To check out your calendar, go to "Events" tab). 
          They also show up in the group calendar (Go to group page and click on "View Calendar" on the right bar). Also, once the examination is complete, you can edit the examination activity and upload the question paper into it. 
          If you are interested, you could scan the student answer paper and submit it against each of their name so that they can refer to it later. You can also enter a score for the exam and later use it in reports. (See reports in advanced section)</p>

        question: Rubrics
