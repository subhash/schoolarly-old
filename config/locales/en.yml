      teachers:
        title: Socialize your classroom

        detail:
          first: 
            one: You would like your students to participate more in discussions surrounding assignments. You need to zero in on those who are finding it difficult to master the material. You would like it if students could contribute their own ideas and references from the internet. You also want them to help each other out when they are stuck at a problem.
            two: Schoolarly lets you manage all this by creating a discussion-space around each assignment and lesson-plan.
          second: 
            one: Review assignments online in Schoolarly. 
            two: You can annotate with inline comments, hightlights, strikeouts or draw sketches right within the assignment. All these markings are preserved for the student in his online copy and she can download the document with the markings intact. You can also grade the assignments with a simple score or using your own rubric scale. While using a rubric, the total score is automatically calculated and can be overwritten, if necessary.

        detail:
          first: 
            title: Assignments made easy!
            content: When an assignment is posted to a class, all the students receive a notification over email and the assignment shows up at the top of their home page as well. They can either compose the submission in the online editor or upload a document. As and when they work on the assignment, they can save draft copies and finally submit it when it's ready. They will received the reviewed assignment with comments from the teacher once it is graded. The score is shown along with the rubric scale used for the assignment 
          second: 
            title: Track your events
            content: Schoolarly provides every student and teacher with an online calendar where any of the activities they are part of - assignments, classes, projects, sport events are marked.
